## Overview

This project predicts estimated salaries based on job-related data such as job title, experience level, and more. It uses machine learning models to perform regression analysis and provide the expected salary range. The model is trained on historical job data and offers predictions based on new input.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nileshsn/Estimated-Salary-Prediction.git
   cd Estimated-Salary-Prediction
2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py

## Usage

- Navigate to the deployed app link or run the app locally.
- Enter job-related details like job title, experience, etc., and the model will predict the estimated salary for the provided information.

## Model

The model is built using machine learning techniques. It was trained on a dataset containing various features related to job roles and salaries. The model uses regression algorithms to estimate the salary for a given set of job-related features.

## Deployment

The app is deployed using Streamlit Cloud. You can check the live preview at the following link: [Estimated Salary Prediction App](https://estimated-salary-prediction-bysojp2c8sckgufndgxnbr.streamlit.app/)
